# Flight and Weather Visualization App

This repository contains a web application that visualizes flight and weather data in real-time. The application displays a map with the current position of a flight, its status, and weather conditions affecting the flight path.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of flight status and location on a map.
- Display of weather conditions including temperature, wind speed, and visibility.
- Weather and flight data are updated dynamically using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Detailed annotations on weather changes and flight altitude and flight status variations.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have Python and all the required packages are installed.
